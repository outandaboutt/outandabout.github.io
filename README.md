## ⭐ Inspiration !
* Addressing the lack of accessibility in various locations 💼🏙️
  - Numerous historic buildings lack accessible bathrooms and proper means to access higher floors, even when essential classes for students with disabilities are held there 🙁

* Creating an easy-to-access map for users to find accommodations that meet their specific requirements
* Prioritizing inclusive features and accessibility options, including health services, community and support centers, and etc. 🏥🫂
* Offering a diverse range of places and accommodations based on user requests and needs ♿🩼
